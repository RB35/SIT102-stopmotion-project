This hasn't realy been built for others to compile but if you want to you'll need the following! (Note this is for Mingw if your using something different you'll need to find the packages your self :) )

`pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-qt6-base mingw-w64-x86_64-opencv`

You'll also need splashkit, cmake and ninja (or other build tool) if you havn't already.
